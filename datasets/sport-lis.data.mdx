    The NASA LIS is a high-performance land surface modeling and data
    assimilation system that can be used to run a variety of LSMs through the
    integration of satellite-derived datasets, ground-based observations and
    model re-analyses to characterize land surface states and fluxes (Kumar et
    al. 2006; Peters-Lidard et al. 2007). The NASA SPoRT Center at MSFC
    developed an in-house configuration of the LIS (i.e., “SPoRT-LIS”) for use
    in experimental operations by both domestic and international weather
    forecasters (Case 2016; Zavodsky et al. 2013; Case and Zavodsky 2018;
    McDonough et al. 2018). The SPoRT-LIS is an observations-driven, historical
    and real-time configuration of LIS that runs of the Noah land surface model
    over a full CONUS domain. SPoRT-LIS provides modeled soil moisture estimates
    at approximately 3-km horizontal grid spacing over a 2-meter deep soil
    column, and has been validated for regional applications (e.g., McDonough et
    al. 2018). The basis of the SPoRT-LIS is a 33-year soil moisture climatology
    spanning 19812013, which is extended to the present time and forced by
    atmospheric analyses from the operational North American Land Data
    Assimilation System-Phase 2 (NLDAS-2; Xia et al. 2012). The 4-day latency
    gap in NLDAS-2 atmospheric forcing input for the SPoRT-LIS is bridged by
    incorporating forcing from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction
    (NCEP) Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS; Wang et al. 2013) in
    combination with hourly MRMS QPE. The real-time component of the SPoRT-LIS
    updates on a six-hourly cycle following the initialization schedule and
    availability of surface flux output files from the GDAS/Global Forecast
    System (GFS; Zhou et al. 2019) NWP model. Besides the minimal data latency,
    another unique feature of SPoRT-LIS is the incorporation since 2012 of
    daily, real-time satellite retrievals of Green Vegetation Fraction (GVF)
    from the NOAA/National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information
    Service (NESDIS) global 4-km resolution product, derived from the Visible
    Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument aboard the
    Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership and the Joint Polar Satellite
    System satellites (Vargas et al. 2015). The 33-year soil moisture
    climatology also provides the database for real-time soil moisture
    percentiles (Zavodsky et al. 2016; Case and Zavodsky 2018) evaluated for all
    U.S. counties and at each model grid point. The current-day soil moisture
    analyses are compared to daily historical distributions to place the present
    conditions into context to determine the soil wet/dry anomalies for the
    specific time of year, similar to that described in Xia et al. (2014).
    Thereafter, soil moisture percentile maps are constructed for the model
    integrated layers, and these data are frequently referenced by scientists
    and operational agencies contributing to the weekly U.S. Drought Monitor
    product.

    # Interpreting the Data

    A variety of output variables are used to depict soil moisture in the SPoRT-LIS analyses. Volumetric soil moisture shows the fraction of volume of water occupying the total soil volume and typically ranges from ~0.03 to 0.45, depending on the defined sand-silt-clay soil classification defined at a given grid point. The volumetric soil moisture is often spatially correlated to the pattern of soil classification; therefore, the relative soil moisture (or percent saturation) can be a preferred method to analyze the soil moisture based on the water-holding capacity of the soils. The relative soil moisture (RSM) is defined as the ratio of the modeled volumetric soil moisture (θ) between the wilting and saturation reference values for a given soil classification:

    *RSM=((θ - θ<sub>wilt</sub>)/(θ<sub>sat</sub>  - θ<sub>wilt</sub> ))  x 100%.				      ...	(1)*

    The RSM essentially normalizes the volumetric soil moisture based on the specified characteristics of each unique soil texture classification (sand-silt-clay composition). Meanwhile, the soil moisture percentiles depict where the current analysis value lies within the histogram distribution of historical soil moisture values. An example of the 0-2 meter soil moisture percentile over Napa County, California shows how the wet 2022-23 winter over central California has contributed to historically high soil moisture values, averaged over all SPoRT-LIS points lying within Napa County, yielding a soil moisture percentile value of 92.9 for 23 March 2023:
