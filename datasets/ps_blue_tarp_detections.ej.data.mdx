Planetscope provides 3-band RGB imagery at 3-meter ground resolution which can support building-scale analysis of the land surface. In the aftermath of natural disasters associated with high wind speeds, homes with damaged roofs typically are covered with blue tarps to protect the interior of the home from further damage. Using machine learning, blue tarps can be detected from the Planetscope imagery using pre-event cloud free images to detect blue pixels and potential impacts after a natural disaster.

## Scientific research
Detection of blue tarps from high resolution imagery can inform disaster response of the most impacted locations. Additionally, given the frequency with which Planetscope scenes are retrieved from the satellite, the rate of recovery for a given location can also be tracked over time. This can also support disaster response to provide aid to specific locations where recovery efforts are lacking.

## Interpreting the data
Machine learning-based detections of blue tarps are displayed as red pixels on the basemap and are available for both Hurricane Maria (2017) and Hurricane Ida (2021). The input true color imagery used to produce the detections are also added as an additional layer and can be used for qualitative validation of the detections.
