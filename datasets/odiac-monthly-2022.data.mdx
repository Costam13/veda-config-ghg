    The Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC) data product is a monthly high-resolution global data product of modeled fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.  A complex model incorporates and combines space-based nighttime light data and individual power plant emission/location profiles to estimate the global spatial extent of fossil fuel CO2 emissions on a 1 km x 1 km grid that details variations in urban regions where emissions are most intense. ODIAC CO2 emission data is widely used by the international research community for applications such as CO2 flux inversion, urban emission estimation, and observing system design experiments. First created in 2009 by Dr. Tomohiro Oda, the ODIAC team is now supported by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA Carbon Monitoring System program, the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory mission and the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) GOSAT project. The GHG Center displays the ODIAC 2022 version containing monthly data from January 2000 to December 2022 that replaces all previous versions.
