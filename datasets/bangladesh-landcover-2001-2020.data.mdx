The annual land cover maps of 2001 and 2021 were captured using combined
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Annual Land Cover Type
dataset (MCD12Q1 V6, dataset link:
[https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd12q1v006/](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd12q1v006/)).
The actual data product provides global land cover types at yearly intervals
(2001-2020) at 500 meters with six different types of land cover
classification. Among six different schemes, The International
Geosphereâ€“Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land cover classification selected and
further simplified to dominant land cover classes (water, urban, cropland,
native vegetation) for two different years to illustrate the changes in land
use and land cover of the country.
