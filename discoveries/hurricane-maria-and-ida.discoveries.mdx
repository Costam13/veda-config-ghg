        ## Connecting Disaster Recovery with Environmental Justice: Hurricane María

        Hurricane María made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 or 5 hurricane on September 20, 2017, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. [Over 1.5 million people on the island lost power, leading to the longest blackout in US history](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218883). Although efforts to repair the damage on the island were extensive, the [areas with the most severe and prolonged impacts were areas of lower socioeconomic status](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218883). These communities lacked the resources and the representation to repair damage quickly, leading to long-term lack of access to electricity, water, and other critical supplies.

        NASA hosts a wide variety of continuous Earth observation data useful in environmental justice research. This dashboard features a selection of NASA datasets from across the Agency, including socioeconomic data, Earth observation analysis, and other combined datasets. These tools allow users to visualize and download data to understand the environmental issues brought on by Hurricane María. Merging Earth data and socioeconomic data can help communities like those in Puerto Rico to better prepare for and respond to future natural disasters.

        ## Connecting Disaster Recovery with Environmental Justice: Hurricane Ida

        Known as the city that can barely catch its breath between storms, New Orleans experienced another devastating event on August 29, 2021 as Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane. The effects of the storm were widespread, causing millions of dollars worth of damage and affecting the lives and homes of millions of people. 

        [Disadvantaged communities](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02520-8) in Louisiana and across the country already struggle with higher rates of asthma, cancer, and COVID-19 infections. These communities are often hardest-hit by storms like Ida. Research has shown that disadvantaged communities often receive less federal aid than other communities, only prolonging their hardships. NASA is prioritizing open access to environmental justice data such as the datasets in this dashboard in an effort to help communities better prepare for and respond to natural disasters and to help shed light on cases of environmental injustice.
