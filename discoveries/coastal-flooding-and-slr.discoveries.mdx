  ## Introduction
  The Earth Information System (EIS) provides a platform for collaborative analysis and decision support for adapting to sea level changes, human-caused water cycle intensification, and their impacts. The full potential of these individual efforts are realized through the EIS collaborative framework to support new transdisciplinary connections.

  ## Evidence of Global Water Cycle Intensification 
  Terrestrial water storage (TWS), corresponding to integrated changes in surface water across rivers, lakes, wetlands, soil moisture, groundwater and snow, is a critical component of the global water and energy budget. The warming climate and other human disturbances are leading to more non-regular changes in terrestrial water storage, imposing emerging threats to water and food security.

  Identifying hot spot regions under non-stationary water cycle changes and exploring the drivers are important issues that may provide information to improve hydrological forecasting and water management. Through interdisciplinary research and data assimilation, the EIS team developed a novel metric to quantify the non-stationarity of the global water cycle, integrating data about long term trends, seasonal shifts, and interannual to sub-seasonal scale variabilities.

  Bangladesh is one of the hot spots regions that is experiencing non-stationary water cycle change, which is mainly evidenced by groundwater depletion from agricultural pumping. Averaged across the country, TWS has depleted at a rate of  almost 13mm/year during 2002-2021, or about 2 billion cubic meters per year countrywide.

    ### Depleting aquifers

  ### Irrigation footprint detected from space
  Leaf area index (LAI), a proxy for vegetation density, can be detected from space through MODIS sensors. MODIS data show a substantial LAI increase across the country, from 2003 to 2020, driven by intensive irrigation.

  ### Changing landscape
  MODIS sensors can also inform us about how land cover has changed over the past two decades. Cropland expansion has resulted in reduced native vegetation across the country. Satellite data also shows coastal land loss since 2001.

   Bangladesh lost about 490 square kilometers of coastal land between 2001 and 2020, mainly caused by human-induced climate change combined with land subsidence. This chart shows annual coastal land loss from 2001 to 2020.
