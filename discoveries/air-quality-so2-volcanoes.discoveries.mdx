    Watching lava and magma flow from an erupting volcano may seem fascinating at first sight. But volcanoes emit dangerous gasses, including [sulfur dioxide](https://so2.gsfc.nasa.gov/so2intro.html) (SO₂), which can be toxic to the human body and to the environment.  Volcanoes are not the only source of SO₂; researchers closely monitor emissions from power plants, smelters (where metals are refined), and oil and gas industry-related sources. NASA’s instruments and satellites play a major role in tracking the gasses and emissions. Using satellite data, scientists and researchers have been able to track changes in SO₂ emissions since 2005, building a catalog of large SO₂ sources and their emissions. This catalog helps update and improve “bottom-up” inventories used in air quality and climate models, evaluate the efficiency of industrial clean technology solutions in reducing air pollution, and monitor changes in SO₂ emissions on a large scale.
