    Watching lava and magma flow from an erupting volcano may seem fascinating at first sight. But volcanoes emit dangerous gasses, including [sulfur dioxide](https://so2.gsfc.nasa.gov/so2intro.html) (SO₂), which can be toxic to the human body and to the environment.  Volcanoes are not the only source of SO₂; researchers closely monitor emissions from power plants, smelters (where metals are refined), and oil and gas industry-related sources. NASA’s instruments and satellites play a major role in tracking the gasses and emissions. Using satellite data, scientists and researchers have been able to track changes in SO₂ emissions since 2005, building a catalog of large SO₂ sources and their emissions. This catalog helps update and improve “bottom-up” inventories used in air quality and climate models, evaluate the efficiency of industrial clean technology solutions in reducing air pollution, and monitor changes in SO₂ emissions on a large scale.

    ## Monitoring Air Pollution with Satellites

    Although nationally, average SO₂ concentrations have decreased substantially over the years, tracking new and existing SO₂  sources is crucial because the gas is an important factor in environmental processes that directly impact our health, the global ecosystem, atmospheric chemistry, and climate. SO₂ irritates the eyes, nose, and lungs. High concentrations of SO₂ can result in temporary breathing impairment. 

    Volcanic gasses are classified as an air pollutant in many countries because of the effects on the human respiratory system. Moreover, it can lead to acid rain, damaging foliage and hindering future growth. Collecting measurements of sulfur dioxide plumes from space is a valuable way to monitor changes in emissions. Data is primarily collected from three sources: the OMI ([Ozone Monitoring Instrument](https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/omi.html#:~:text=About%20OMI,data%20to%20derive%20tropospheric%20ozone.)) on the NASA [EOS Aura](https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/) satellite since 2004; the [Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite](https://ozoneaq.gsfc.nasa.gov/omps/) (OMPS) on NASA-NOAA’s [NPP Suomi](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/main/index.html) satellite, which launched in 2011; and the [Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument](http://www.tropomi.eu/) (TROPOMI) on the ESA Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite since 2017. These satellites retrieve SO₂ vertical column densities (VCDs) from measurements in the UV part of the spectrum. The retrieved SO₂ VCDs correspond to 1-km thick sulfur dioxide plumes located near the surface. 

    The current catalog of major emissions consists of 759 sources including 477 power plants, 74 smelters, 102 oil and gas related sources, and 106 volcanoes. This is a steep increase from the first catalog, introduced in 2016, which logged 491 sources. This increase can be attributed to the addition of TROPOMI data, which made it possible to track smaller sources. The data, however, indicates a decline of approximately 50% overall in global SO₂ emissions between 2005 and 2021.
