    ## Multiple Efforts to Monitor Global Tree Cover

    Trees and other plants pull vast amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere every year. They incorporate some of that carbon into their organic structure, what Earth scientists call plant biomass. Measuring and monitoring the size and changes in this biomass carbon is an important part of the Paris Agreement on climate change. If a forest is cut down, for example, the carbon stored in those trees will count towards that country'’'s annual carbon emissions.  
    
    As part of the Paris Agreement, the [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://unfccc.int/) will take stock of the best available information on aboveground biomass carbon in 2023, as part of their Global Stocktake. The Global Stocktake will set benchmarks for how much biomass carbon exists on land. The UNFCCC will use these benchmarks to track countries’ progress toward meeting [Paris Agreement targets](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement).  
    
    Satellites can provide reliable estimates of aboveground biomass and carbon content to help track and monitor land cover and tree height . Mapping aboveground biomass is an international priority of several ongoing, new, and upcoming NASA, European Space Agency (ESA), and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) satellite missions. These include several ongoing missions:

    - **Copernicus Sentinel-1** (two polar-orbiting satellites);
    - **Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation**, aka GEDI (measures Earth's forests and topography);
    - **Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2**, aka ICESat-2 (measures ice sheet elevation and sea ice thickness); and
    - **Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2**, aka ALOS-2 (provides cartography, regional observations, and resource survey data).

    These missions will be joined by the upcoming Advanced Land Observing Satellite-4, ALOS-4, BIOMASS, and NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) missions in the coming years.
