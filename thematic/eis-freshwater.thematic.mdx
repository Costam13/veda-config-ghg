    ## Earth Information System (EIS)

    Today’s most pressing Earth Science research questions increasingly require an integrated observing and analysis strategy that synthesizes many datasets with a variety of simulation models. This integration requires contributions from large groups of diverse experts at a wide range of institutions, and the results of this work need to be effectively disseminated to end users. The NASA Earth Information System (EIS) is an interdisciplinary collaborative research and applications activity that combines Earth Science observations and modeling capabilities to produce new science and support decision-making. Crucially, the emphasis of EIS is on producing and delivering actionable information by working closely with stakeholders to tackle their most pressing problems and inform their decisions with NASA data. For example, EIS seeks to help stakeholders provide answers to questions such as:

    *Will the air in my area be unsafe to breathe because of smoke from fires?​*

    *Will my area flood during the next big storm?​*

    *Will there be enough water for my crops this season?​*

    EIS currently has four topic areas: fires, freshwater, sea level change, and greenhouse gasses. This thematic area focuses on freshwater.

    ## Freshwater

    Freshwater is what makes Earth habitable, sustaining ecosystems and human civilization. The global water cycle enables the supply of water and regulation of weather patterns. The cycling of water links the changes on land with the ocean and atmosphere. The quantification of the variability of the components of the water cycle is key to understanding and managing water availability. However, thoroughly understanding freshwater is complex because multiple Earth Systems interact with each other including processes that govern precipitation, ground moisture retention, snow cover, depth & melt, evapotranspiration, and vegetation coverage and function. 

    The EIS-Freshwater project provides an interface to describe NASA water cycle science in a simple manner that appeals to a broad set of users including scientists, applied science users, water managers, and the general public. The objectives of the current phase of EIS-Freshwater are as follows:

    1. **Fire-hydrology interactions:** Quantify hydrological causes and impacts of fires
    2. **Inland and coastal flooding:** Examine influence of sea level change, water cycle acceleration, and water management on coastal flooding, and evaluate flooding impacts.
    3. **Water security assessment:** Evaluate how water availability and quality are affected by changes in water and nutrient fluxes
    4. **Shifts in water cycle fluxes and stocks:** Evaluate how water fluxes, stocks, and extremes are changing, including the role of climate change
    5. **Science translation with AI:** Develop a natural language interface to freshwater datasets and models powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP)

    EIS-Freshwater stakeholders include the Amazon Environmental Research Institute - Brazil (IPAM-Brazil), the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Nature Conservancy, the Bangladesh Water Development Board, the US Department of Agriculture, National Geographic, and many more.
