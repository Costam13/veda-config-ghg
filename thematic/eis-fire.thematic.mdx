    ## Earth Information System (EIS)

    Today’s most pressing Earth Science research questions increasingly require an integrated observing and analysis strategy that synthesizes many datasets with a variety of simulation models. This integration requires contributions from large groups of diverse experts at a wide range of institutions, and the results of this work need to be effectively disseminated to end users. The NASA Earth Information System (EIS) is an interdisciplinary collaborative research and applications activity that combines Earth Science observations and modeling capabilities to produce new science and support decision-making. Crucially, the emphasis of EIS is on producing and delivering actionable information by working closely with stakeholders to tackle their most pressing problems and inform their decisions with NASA data. For example, EIS seeks to help stakeholders provide answers to questions such as:

    *Will the air in my area be unsafe to breathe because of smoke from fires?​*

    *Will my area flood during the next big storm?​*

    *Will there be enough water for my crops this season?​*

    EIS currently has four topic areas: fires, freshwater, sea level change, and greenhouse gasses. This thematic area focuses on fires.

    ## Fires
    Fires are an integral part of the Earth system, primarily through land-atmosphere interactions that determine fire risk, fire spread, and fire emissions. Information on fires is used by a variety of stakeholders, including scientists, firefighters, land managers, public health officials, and the public. Fires also intersect many NASA measurement, research, and applications areas, including terrestrial ecology, meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, and land cover and land use change. NASA data products and models provide real-time information on active fires, smoke, air quality, and forecasts of changing fire weather and seasonal fire risk. The full potential of these independent efforts has not yet been realized, in part due to the need to build new connections among existing components.

    The overarching vision of the EIS-Fire project is to combine satellite, airborne, and ground observations with models to provide a platform for analysis and decision support for pre-fire risk, active fire situational awareness, and post-fire impacts. To that end, the current phase of EIS-Fire has 5 major objectives:

    Real-time global fire event monitoring: Tracking every fire on Earth, every 12 hours, using an automated algorithm that converts satellite measurements of fire radiative power on a pixel-by-pixel basis to maps of the active fire perimeter and cumulative burned area.
    Fire risk modeling and forecasting: Leveraging our ability to map fire events globally to evaluate how good models of fire spread really are and how to make them better
    Develop 1-5 day fire spread forecasts: Combine our improved knowledge of individual fire events with fire weather forecasts using machine learning.
    Improve representation of fires and fire emissions in atmospheric models: Update model information related to emissions from different land cover types, improve the representation of the diurnal cycle of fires, and evaluate new model predictions against satellite, airborne, and ground-based measurements of atmospheric composition and air quality.
    Post-fire debris flow monitoring, forecasting, and management: Combine maps of individual fire events, satellite land cover observations, and model-based products of precipitation and runoff to provide near-real-time assessments and forecasts of post-fire debris flow risk.

    In working on these tasks, the EIS-Fire is partnering with a variety of stakeholders, including the US Forest Service (USFS), the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the US Department of Energy, and regional Air Quality Management Districts.
