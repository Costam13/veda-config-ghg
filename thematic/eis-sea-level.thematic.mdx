    ## Earth Information System (EIS)

    Today’s most pressing Earth Science research questions increasingly require an integrated observing and analysis strategy that synthesizes many datasets with a variety of simulation models. This integration requires contributions from large groups of diverse experts at a wide range of institutions, and the results of this work need to be effectively disseminated to end users. The NASA Earth Information System (EIS) is an interdisciplinary collaborative research and applications activity that combines Earth Science observations and modeling capabilities to produce new science and support decision-making. Crucially, the emphasis of EIS is on producing and delivering actionable information by working closely with stakeholders to tackle their most pressing problems and inform their decisions with NASA data. For example, EIS seeks to help stakeholders provide answers to questions such as:

    *Will the air in my area be unsafe to breathe because of smoke from fires?​*

    *Will my area flood during the next big storm?​*

    *Will there be enough water for my crops this season?​*

    EIS currently has four topic areas: fires, freshwater, sea level change, and greenhouse gasses. This thematic area focuses on sea level change.

    ## Sea Level Change

    Understanding sea-level variability is challenging because sea-level science is highly multidisciplinary, with the contributing processes acting on a very broad range of spatial and temporal scales. Individual research groups typically need access to the same observational datasets, software, and model output; however, most work on a variety of on-premises platforms that are not directly linked to one another. The fractured nature of current data and computing systems makes it challenging to make rapid progress on the timescales of scientific research grants (3-5 years). As NASA’s Earth System Observatory comes to fruition, new tools and platforms are needed to allow multidisciplinary teams, spread across various institutions, to make faster scientific progress, especially given that future missions will collect exponentially more data than the current program of record.

    The overarching goal of the EIS-Sea Level Change activity is to produce a system that supports collaborative scientific research, streamlines the process of creating sea level change products from raw observations, and facilitates the development of impactful tools requested by stakeholders. The current phase of the EIS-Sea Level Change activity focuses on:

    1. **Ice sheet contribution to sea-level change:** Improving estimates of ice sheet mass change by connecting model ensembles with satellite observations in the cloud.
    2. **Sea-level change attribution with ECCO:** Advancing our understanding of the role of ocean processes in sea-level change and increasing the ease of accessibility for ECCO model output.
    3. **Support for SWOT science team:** Developing a science collaboration environment in the cloud for SWOT Science Team research; a trailblazer for the Earth System Observatory.
    4. **N-SLCT portal tools:** Creating clear and easy-to-use tools for stakeholders and decision makers.

    EIS-Sea Level Change stakeholder engagement is primarily through the existing [NASA Sea Level Change Team (NSLCT)](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/science-team/overview), which has a practitioner advisory board with members from the US Geological Survey, the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, the US Naval Facilities Engineering Command, the Philadelphia Water Department, and other organizations.
