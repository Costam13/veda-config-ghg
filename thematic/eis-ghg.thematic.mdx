    ## Earth Information System (EIS)

    Today’s most pressing Earth Science research questions increasingly require an integrated observing and analysis strategy that synthesizes many datasets with a variety of simulation models. This integration requires contributions from large groups of diverse experts at a wide range of institutions, and the results of this work need to be effectively disseminated to end users. The NASA Earth Information System (EIS) is an interdisciplinary collaborative research and applications activity that combines Earth Science observations and modeling capabilities to produce new science and support decision-making. Crucially, the emphasis of EIS is on producing and delivering actionable information by working closely with stakeholders to tackle their most pressing problems and inform their decisions with NASA data. For example, EIS seeks to help stakeholders provide answers to questions such as:

    *Will the air in my area be unsafe to breathe because of smoke from fires?​*

    *Will my area flood during the next big storm?​*

    *Will there be enough water for my crops this season?​*

    EIS currently has four topic areas: fires, freshwater, sea level change, and greenhouse gasses. This thematic area focuses on greehouse gasses.

    ## Greenhouse Gasses

    Understanding the changes in source and sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) and how they are changing is a signature challenge in Earth System Science and critically important for nations working to implement effective climate change mitigation strategies. Though land and ocean carbon sinks currently absorb about half of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, changes in these exchanges of carbon in a warming world lead to large uncertainties in model projections of future climate. Changes in CH4 concentrations over recent decades are less well understood with recent studies debating a variety of different, plausible mechanisms for changes in the atmospheric growth rate. Satellites have provided a transformation in understanding of many components of the carbon cycle. When combined with high quality modeling and data assimilation systems, these data can monitor recent changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, provide attribution of the most important emission and loss processes, and take stock of the carbon sequestered by land biomass across the world. Though several NASA programs, (Carbon Monitoring System, OCO-2 Science Team, Interdisciplinary Science) have funded development of groundbreaking prototype products, the lack of integration and regular cadence of product delivery updates has limited the ability of NASA to provide authoritative and timely information on GHGs thereby limiting rapid science synthesis and support for  stakeholders needs at a variety of administrative levels. 

    The overarching vision of Earth Information System – Greenhouse Gasses (EIS-GHG) is to provide a suite of coherent datasets and cyberinfrastructure needed to support research and applications on the recent changes on GHG concentrations and their drivers. To that end, EIS-GHG will provide comprehensive information needed to characterize the state of greenhouse gasses with reliability, transparency, and low latency. For the first year of this pilot project, the main goals are to expand access to and interoperability of existing datasets while building the transparency needed for open science. Specific tasks include:

    1. Designing and prototyping a data system for NASA GHG monitoring products that supports carbon cycle research and applications
    2. Delivering high quality, low latency information about changes in GHGs 
    3. Providing rigorous benchmarking for NASA GHG products in support of open source science
    4. Demonstrating cross-cutting analysis: Balance of natural and anthropogenic anomalies on the carbon balance during the COVID era  (2020-2021)
    5. Promoting community engagement and report key findings including scoping needs for coherent, long term GHG monitoring and information system

    EIS-GHG stakeholders include the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), among others.
