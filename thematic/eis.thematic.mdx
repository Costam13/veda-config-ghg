    ## Earth Information System (EIS)

    Today’s most pressing Earth Science research questions increasingly require an integrated observing and analysis strategy that synthesizes many datasets with a variety of simulation models. This integration requires contributions from large groups of diverse experts at a wide range of institutions, and the results of this work need to be effectively disseminated to end users. The NASA Earth Information System (EIS) is an interdisciplinary collaborative research and applications activity that combines Earth Science observations and modeling capabilities to produce new science and support decision-making. Crucially, the emphasis of EIS is on producing and delivering actionable information by working closely with stakeholders to tackle their most pressing problems and inform their decisions with NASA data. For example, EIS seeks to help stakeholders provide answers to questions such as:

    * Will the air in my area be unsafe to breathe because of smoke from fires?​*

    * Will my area flood during the next big storm?​*

    * Will there be enough water for my crops this season?​*

    EIS currently has four topic areas: fires, freshwater, sea level change, and greenhouse gasses.

    ## Fires

    Fires are an integral part of the Earth system, primarily through land-atmosphere interactions that determine fire risk, fire spread, and fire emissions. Information on fires is used by a variety of stakeholders, including scientists, firefighters, land managers, public health officials, and the public. Fires also intersect many NASA measurement, research, and applications areas, including terrestrial ecology, meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, and land cover and land use change. NASA data products and models provide real-time information on active fires, smoke, air quality, and forecasts of changing fire weather and seasonal fire risk. The full potential of these independent efforts has not yet been realized, in part due to the need to build new connections among existing components.

    The overarching vision of the EIS-Fire project is to combine satellite, airborne, and ground observations with models to provide a platform for analysis and decision support for pre-fire risk, active fire situational awareness, and post-fire impacts. To that end, the current phase of EIS-Fire has 5 major objectives:

    * **Real-time global fire event monitoring**: Tracking every fire on Earth, every 12 hours, using an automated algorithm that converts satellite measurements of fire radiative power on a pixel-by-pixel basis to maps of the active fire perimeter and cumulative burned area.
    * **Fire risk modeling and forecasting**: Leveraging our ability to map fire events globally to evaluate how good models of fire spread really are and how to make them better
    * **Develop 1-5 day fire spread forecasts**: Combine our improved knowledge of individual fire events with fire weather forecasts using machine learning.
    * **Improve representation of fires and fire emissions in atmospheric models**: Update model information related to emissions from different land cover types, improve the representation of the diurnal cycle of fires, and evaluate new model predictions against satellite, airborne, and ground-based measurements of atmospheric composition and air quality.
    * **Post-fire debris flow monitoring, forecasting, and management**: Combine maps of individual fire events, satellite land cover observations, and model-based products of precipitation and runoff to provide near-real-time assessments and forecasts of post-fire debris flow risk.

    In working on these tasks, the EIS-Fire is partnering with a variety of stakeholders, including the US Forest Service (USFS), the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the US Department of Energy, and regional Air Quality Management Districts.

    ## Freshwater

    Freshwater is what makes Earth habitable, sustaining ecosystems and human civilization. The global water cycle enables the supply of water and regulation of weather patterns. The cycling of water links the changes on land with the ocean and atmosphere. The quantification of the variability of the components of the water cycle is key to understanding and managing water availability. However, thoroughly understanding freshwater is complex because multiple Earth Systems interact with each other including processes that govern precipitation, ground moisture retention, snow cover, depth & melt, evapotranspiration, and vegetation coverage and function. 

    The EIS-Freshwater project provides an interface to describe NASA water cycle science in a simple manner that appeals to a broad set of users including scientists, applied science users, water managers, and the general public. The objectives of the current phase of EIS-Freshwater are as follows:

    1. **Fire-hydrology interactions:** Quantify hydrological causes and impacts of fires
    2. **Inland and coastal flooding:** Examine influence of sea level change, water cycle acceleration, and water management on coastal flooding, and evaluate flooding impacts.
    3. **Water security assessment:** Evaluate how water availability and quality are affected by changes in water and nutrient fluxes
    4. **Shifts in water cycle fluxes and stocks:** Evaluate how water fluxes, stocks, and extremes are changing, including the role of climate change
    5. **Science translation with AI:** Develop a natural language interface to freshwater datasets and models powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP)

    EIS-Freshwater stakeholders include the Amazon Environmental Research Institute - Brazil (IPAM-Brazil), the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Nature Conservancy, the Bangladesh Water Development Board, the US Department of Agriculture, National Geographic, and many more.

    ## Sea Level Change

    Understanding sea-level variability is challenging because sea-level science is highly multidisciplinary, with the contributing processes acting on a very broad range of spatial and temporal scales. Individual research groups typically need access to the same observational datasets, software, and model output; however, most work on a variety of on-premises platforms that are not directly linked to one another. The fractured nature of current data and computing systems makes it challenging to make rapid progress on the timescales of scientific research grants (3-5 years). As NASA’s Earth System Observatory comes to fruition, new tools and platforms are needed to allow multidisciplinary teams, spread across various institutions, to make faster scientific progress, especially given that future missions will collect exponentially more data than the current program of record.

    The overarching goal of the EIS-Sea Level Change activity is to produce a system that supports collaborative scientific research, streamlines the process of creating sea level change products from raw observations, and facilitates the development of impactful tools requested by stakeholders. The current phase of the EIS-Sea Level Change activity focuses on:

    1. **Ice sheet contribution to sea-level change:** Improving estimates of ice sheet mass change by connecting model ensembles with satellite observations in the cloud.
    2. **Sea-level change attribution with ECCO:** Advancing our understanding of the role of ocean processes in sea-level change and increasing the ease of accessibility for ECCO model output.
    3. **Support for SWOT science team:** Developing a science collaboration environment in the cloud for SWOT Science Team research; a trailblazer for the Earth System Observatory.
    4. **N-SLCT portal tools:** Creating clear and easy-to-use tools for stakeholders and decision makers.

    EIS-Sea Level Change stakeholder engagement is primarily through the existing [NASA Sea Level Change Team (NSLCT)](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/science-team/overview), which has a practitioner advisory board with members from the US Geological Survey, the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, the US Naval Facilities Engineering Command, the Philadelphia Water Department, and other organizations.

    ## Greenhouse Gasses

    Understanding the changes in source and sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) and how they are changing is a signature challenge in Earth System Science and critically important for nations working to implement effective climate change mitigation strategies. Though land and ocean carbon sinks currently absorb about half of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, changes in these exchanges of carbon in a warming world lead to large uncertainties in model projections of future climate. Changes in CH4 concentrations over recent decades are less well understood with recent studies debating a variety of different, plausible mechanisms for changes in the atmospheric growth rate. Satellites have provided a transformation in understanding of many components of the carbon cycle. When combined with high quality modeling and data assimilation systems, these data can monitor recent changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, provide attribution of the most important emission and loss processes, and take stock of the carbon sequestered by land biomass across the world. Though several NASA programs, (Carbon Monitoring System, OCO-2 Science Team, Interdisciplinary Science) have funded development of groundbreaking prototype products, the lack of integration and regular cadence of product delivery updates has limited the ability of NASA to provide authoritative and timely information on GHGs thereby limiting rapid science synthesis and support for  stakeholders needs at a variety of administrative levels. 

    The overarching vision of Earth Information System – Greenhouse Gasses (EIS-GHG) is to provide a suite of coherent datasets and cyberinfrastructure needed to support research and applications on the recent changes on GHG concentrations and their drivers. To that end, EIS-GHG will provide comprehensive information needed to characterize the state of greenhouse gasses with reliability, transparency, and low latency. For the first year of this pilot project, the main goals are to expand access to and interoperability of existing datasets while building the transparency needed for open science. Specific tasks include:

    1. Designing and prototyping a data system for NASA GHG monitoring products that supports carbon cycle research and applications
    2. Delivering high quality, low latency information about changes in GHGs 
    3. Providing rigorous benchmarking for NASA GHG products in support of open source science
    4. Demonstrating cross-cutting analysis: Balance of natural and anthropogenic anomalies on the carbon balance during the COVID era  (2020-2021)
    5. Promoting community engagement and report key findings including scoping needs for coherent, long term GHG monitoring and information system

    EIS-GHG stakeholders include the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), among others.
