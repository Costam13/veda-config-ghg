    ## Earth Information System (EIS)

    Today’s most pressing Earth System Science challenge is to support near-term and long-range analysis and decision making for preparation, mitigation, and resilience in response to climate change. NASA’s Earth Information System (EIS) was established in 2021, with a mission to deliver accessible and actionable information on the Earth system and to serve as a platform for understanding and answering some critical questions about the Earth’s complex systems.

    EIS is a transdisciplinary collaborative research and applications activity that combines NASA’s satellite observations with numerical modeling capabilities to produce new integrated information enabled by emerging technology. Thoroughly understanding the Earth as one cohesive system is complex because various components of the Earth system interact with each other, and the contributing processes may act on a range of spatial and temporal scales. The EIS team has developed an integrative approach, establishing the feasibility and value of EIS, focusing on a transdisciplinary approach to Earth science. The EIS teams’ approach is supported by a rich scientific collaboration allowing engagement with stakeholders and fosters co-development process from the early stages. EIS is leveraging capabilities provided by the [Science Managed Cloud Environment](https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/systems/SMCE) (SMCE) and the [Visualization, Exploration, and Data Analysis](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda) (VEDA) project, which incorporates the data systems and visualizations to ensure the information is understandable and intuitive.

    ## EIS Goals

        * **Goal 1**: Synthesize discipline-specific understanding into Earth system understanding, with relevance to applications and enabled by emerging cyberinfrastructure

        * **Goal 2**: Improve transparency and accessibility of data and methods in support of NASA’s Transition to Open Science (TOPS)

        The Earth Information System (EIS) project is a pathfinder for the open source science integrated Earth system studies, helping to realize the promise of an Earth Information Center (EIC) with plans to further extend the accessibility and reach of NASA science.

        Initially, the EIS team focused on multidisciplinary science integration and synthesis within the thematic areas of  [Freshwater](https://freshwater.eis.smce.nasa.gov/), [Fire](https://eis-fire.mysmce.com/), and [Sea Level](https://sealevel.eis.smce.nasa.gov/). The EIS expanded to include Greenhouse gases (GHGs) with a goal to provide a suite of coherent datasets on the recent changes on GHG concentrations and their drivers. EIS aims to combine the capabilities and competencies of these multidisciplinary teams, spanning a wide range of research, applied and informatic competencies, modeling and data systems capabilities, to tackle Earth system science questions.

        Under the EIS transdisciplinary approach, research & applications and data systems are working together under one project to develop stories of transdisciplinary Earth system science.

        See some transdisciplinary science examples that connect fire impacts with hydrology and quantifies coastal risk from sea level rise compounded by water cycle intensification.
