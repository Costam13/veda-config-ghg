NASA is making a long-term commitment to create an inclusive Open Science community so that NASA science and technology benefits people across the U.S. and its territories by helping them make informed decisions about challenges they face in their communities. The agency’s Earth Science Division (ESD) supports environmental justice communities by expanding awareness, accessibility, and use of Earth science data and enabling contributions to Earth science research and applications. When paired with socioeconomic data, NASA Earth data equips decision makers, community leaders, and individuals with the information they need to help identify environmental hazards in their own communities.
 
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice as the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. The White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council further defines environmental justice communities as "geographic locations within the U.S. and its territories with significant representation of persons of color, low-income persons, indigenous persons or members of Tribal nations, where such individuals experience, or are at risk of experiencing, higher or more adverse human health or environmental outcomes”.
 
Some environmental hazards and events that result in environmental injustices include natural disasters, drought, air and water pollution, urban heat exposure, and proximity to emissions of hazardous and toxic substances. Addressing environmental justice requires an understanding of environmental conditions, locations, and communities at risk of environmental hazards. Environmental justice research is complex and interdisciplinary, drawing from Earth science, socioeconomics, health sciences, and many other fields.

This dashboard will feature environmental justice case studies, beginning with Hurricane Ida and Hurricane Maria.
